# Pixel Sprite Canvas

## Requirements
* NodeJS(if you need to install Jade)
* Gruntjs
* Jade (to compile HTML file)
* SCSS (to compile CSS file)
* jQuery

## What it does
Pixel Sprite Canvas is a simple page I made during one of the days of my spring break
that allows you to make 8,16, or 32-bit sprite.
Some features include:
* Color palatte (Google's and Designmodo's color palattes)
* Erase Mode (hit the 'e' key to toggle it)
* Fill the canvas with a certain color
* clear the canvas
* redefine grid size
